# Monte-Carlo-Simulations

Wireless Sensor Network's deployment Simulation.

Assume a uniform random process governs the deployment of WSN. Perform
Monte Carlo simulations to find out the necessary number of 99% sensing
coverage as a function of sensing radius. Assume disk sensing model. Assume
that the deployment is done on 100m by 100m square 2D region.
