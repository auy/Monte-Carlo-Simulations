# Monte-Carlo-Simulations

Wireless Sensor Network's deployment Simulation.

Assume a uniform random process governs the deployment of WSN. Perform
Monte Carlo simulations to find out the necessary number of 99% sensing
coverage as a function of sensing radius. Assume disk sensing model. Assume
that the deployment is done on 100m by 100m square 2D region. Take into
consideration statistical significance. (Answers based on single experiments
will not be graded). State all your extra assumptions. Give table(s)
summarizing the data for all your experiment results and also draw figure(s)
for visual assesment. You must submit your simulation code in a form that
allows the instructor to repeat the experiments if necessary.
